Pan Gon's Ulsan fall in Club World Cup opener

ORLANDO (United States): Kim Pan Gon, who quit his post as Malaysia's national coach abruptly last year, saw his new team, Ulsan HD, lose 1-0 to African side Mamelodi Sundowns in a Club World Cup Group F opener on Tuesday.

Last year, Pan Gon told the FA of Malaysia (FAM) that he had to break his contract (with 17 months remaining) and return to South Korea due to "family issues".

FAM granted Pan Gon an early release on compassionate grounds, but was shocked to know later that he had joined Korean club, Ulsan, as their coach.

Meanwhile Reuters reported that Ulsan and Sundowns had targeted their opening match as their best chance to get a win in the Club World Cup with Brazil's Fluminense and Germany's Borussia Dortmund expected to advance from Group F.

African and Asian teams are not expected to make much of an impact at the 32-team Club World Cup, so points are like gold dust for the likes of Ulsan and Sundowns.

Pan Gon said: "We had targeted this game to win because we understand the other two teams in the group, Fluminense and Borussia Dortmund, are favourites.

"Our players gave their best efforts in this game and we're very proud of their efforts. Now we need to recover quickly for the next game."

Sundowns coach Miguel Cardoso said: "We prepared tactically and strategically very well. It was important that we could keep the pace and not stray from the game plan in the second half."
