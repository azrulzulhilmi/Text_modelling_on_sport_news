Sze Fei-Izzuddin in danger of losing world No. 1 ranking

KUALA LUMPUR: World No. 1 Goh Sze Fei-Nur Izzuddin Rumsani must regain their edge quickly ahead of next month's Japan Open (July 15-20) and China Open (July 22-27), or risk losing their top spot.

The independent pair captured both titles last year and must now defend their points to stay at the summit.

Since lifting the India Open in January, Sze Fei-Izzuddin have struggled to maintain momentum, failing to add another title to their World Tour campaign.

They have reached the quarter-finals in each of their last four tournaments.

The Japan Open is a Super 750 event offering 11,000 points to the winners, while the China Open is a prestigious Super 1000 tournament, with 13,500 points up for grabs.

Former national player Datuk James Selvaraj believes the pair must rediscover the focus that powered their rise following their departure from the BA of Malaysia last year.

"They need to recapture the form and focus they showed after leaving BAM," James told Timesport on Sunday.

"That's their main problem now. They've got time to fine-tune their game before Japan and China, and they must make it count.

"Getting to world No. 1 is tough, but staying there takes even more effort. You don't want to be top one week and drop to No. 2 or 3 the next."

Sze Fei-Izzuddin currently hold 91,090 points, but are being chased down by compatriots and former world champions Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik, who moved up to No. 2 this week with 89,870 points â€” just 1,220 behind.

Aaron-Wooi Yik, also the reigning Asian champions, will be gunning to leapfrog their rivals and claim the world No. 1 ranking for the first time along with bragging rights as Malaysia's top men's doubles pair.
