Real test begins in q-finals for Joachim and Ameeshenraj

PETALING JAYA: It’s time for young squash players Joachim Chuah and C. Ameeshenraj to step up in the Asian Championships.

Joachim and Ameeshenraj have booked their tickets for the quarter-finals in contrasting styles but the real test for both of them will start from now on.

Joachim, ranked 196th in the world, stunned world No. 57 Noor Zaman of Pakistan 11-3, 11-3, 3-11, 10-12, 11-2 in a topsy-turvy third round match at the Sarawak Squash Centre in Kuching yesterday.

He will play India’s S. Velavan next for a place in the semi-finals.

World No. 86 Ameeshenraj came from behind to beat India’s Suraj Chand 5-11, 11-3, 11-4, 11-3 to set up a match against top seed Abdulla Al-Tamimi of Qatar next.

National coaching director Andrew Cross was happy with the performance of the 20-year-old Joachim and Ameeshenraj, 21, but admits their challenge would get tougher in their bid for the Asian title.

“Joachim and Ameeshenraj are the ones left in the men’s event, and both of them did very well to make it to the quarter-finals,” said Cross.

“They have very tough opponents coming up, but they are young and need these matches to aid their development.”

National No. 2 Sanjay Jeeva and Duncan Lee had earlier crashed out.

In the women’s event, Malaysia’s top and second seed Rachel Arnold and Aira Azman checked into the quarter-finals but Hong Kong players Tong Tsz Wing and Lee Ka Yi stand in their ways to the semis.

One semi-final ticket is assured with Aifa Azman setting up an all-quarter-final match against Yee Xin Ying.
