Haikal-Hon Jian’s belief remains firm despite shaky start in comeback

PETALING JAYA: Men’s doubles shuttlers Mohd Haikal Nazri-Choong Hon Jian believe they still have the quality to close the gap on their higher-ranked national teammates despite a rough start to their comeback.

The pair have had little to shout about in five tournaments so far this season, crashing out in the opening round in all but one, the Malaysian Masters in late May, where they bowed out in the second round.

Haikal admitted that their current form has been worrying, with both still trying to regain their rhythm after lengthy layoffs due to injuries.

Haikal was sidelined for several months after tearing his hip muscle earlier this year. Ironically, Hon Jian had suffered the same injury just months earlier, forcing the duo to pull out of several tournaments, including the Arctic and Denmark Opens.

“There’s no issue between us when it comes to communication, but with both of us struggling with injuries at different times, it’s been difficult. It has definitely affected our performance,” said Haikal.

“Hon Jian and I are determined to recapture the form we showed in India two years ago and when we won the Orleans Masters last year.

“Honestly, after five months out and only one month of training, we were sent straight into five back-to-back tournaments. It’s been a real struggle, and we’ve felt the pressure.”

The former world No. 18 duo have now slipped to No. 47 in the latest world rankings.

Still, Haikal-Hon Jian are refusing to throw in the towel. They believe they can return to their best as long as they stay committed and injury free.

They are currently preparing for the Japan Open from July 15-20, followed by the China Open the following week.

“We know the touch is still there, we just haven’t been able to find it again. I’ll admit we’ve been lacking consistency.

“After each match, especially in these last five events, I’ve just been thankful to walk away uninjured.

“Losing is tough, but nothing compares to the pain of another injury and the long months of rehab that come with it,” he added.
