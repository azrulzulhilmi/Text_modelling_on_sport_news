Hockey: Luck just wasn’t on Speedy Tigers’ side, says Sarjit

BUKIT JALIL: National hockey team head coach Sarjit Singh believes luck just wasn’t on their side to make it into the Nations Cup semi-finals. 

The Speedy Tigers won 2-1 in their final group stage fixture against Japan at the National Hockey Stadium on Wednesday (June 18), but it wasn’t enough to see them enter the semi-finals.

Malaysia needed to win by two goals which would have given them the goal difference margin to finish in second place, ahead of Pakistan who also have four points in the tournament after three matches.

But the win was not enough as Pakistan booked their spot in the semis alongside Group B winners New Zealand.

Malaysia head coach Sarjit Singh was left with mixed emotions, as the win was commendable, but the result was avoidable.

“I think the boys played well, as a coach I’m proud of them. We had the opportunities, but luck was not there.

“We had full control of the game, except for the last minutes when we conceded,” said Sarjit after the match.

Malaysia’s first goal came early as Fitri Saari breezed past the defence and gave Norsyafiq Sumantri the perfect assist to put the hosts ahead after five minutes.

The action continued in the second quarter when Azrai Aizad Abu Kamal made it 2-0 in the 26th minute through a field goal with an assist from Shello Silverius.

But Japan weren’t going to take their defeat quietly as Koji Yamasaki scored in the 56th minute, putting an end to Malaysia’s hopes of advancing to the semis.

Malaysia will now play the fifth-eighth placing fixture against South Africa on Friday, and Sarjit made sure his team knows what’s at stake now.

“We have to shift our focus to finishing fifth now. We must get it. We can’t be playing for seventh or eighth position,” he said.
