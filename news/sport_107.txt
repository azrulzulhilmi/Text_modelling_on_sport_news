Heartbreak for Speedy Tigers after missing out on Nations Cup semis

BUKIT JALIL: Malaysia’s hopes of making it into the Nations Cup semi-finals were dashed despite the hockey team's 2-1 victory over Japan in their final Group B match.

The Speedy Tigers needed to win by two goals against Japan to finish second in the group and advance to the semi-finals at the National Hockey Stadium but they fell short on Wednesday (June 18).

They lost out by one goal difference to Pakistan, who joined group winners New Zealand to the knockout stage.

Earlier, New Zealand had revived hope for Malaysia by beating Pakistan 4-3 but the hosts failed to capitalise on it.

Malaysia’s first goal came quickly as Fitri Saari breezed past the defence and gave Norsyafiq Sumantri the perfect assist to put the hosts ahead after five minutes.

The nail-biting action continued in the second quarter and head coach Sarjit Singh could breathe a sigh of relief when Azrai Aizad Abu Kamal made it 2-0 in the 26th minute through a field goal with an assist from Shello Silverius.

But Japan ruined the party for the hosts when Koji Yamasaki scored in the 56th minute.

Malaysia will now play the fifth-eighth placing fixture against South Africa on Friday.
