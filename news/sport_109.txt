Blow to MFL as giants Pahang withdraw from Super League

PETALING JAYA: Pahang have finally put an end to the uncertainty over their future in the Malaysian League after confirming their withdrawal from next season’s campaign.

Speculation had been rife since late March over the fate of the 2004 Super League champions, although hopes were briefly lifted when they secured a national licence from the independent First Instance Body (FIB).

However, the Malaysian Football League (MFL) have now confirmed that the club submitted an official letter dated June 16 to inform the governing body of their decision to opt out of all competitions for the 2025-2026 season.

Pahang’s exit means only 13 teams will feature in the top-tier domestic league, which kicks off on Aug 8.

“Clubs competing for honours this season include Johor Darul Ta’zim (JDT), Selangor, Penang, Kuching City, Sabah, Terengganu, Negri Sembilan, Kelantan, Kuala Lumpur, Police and Brunei, along with AFL A1 representatives Melaka and Imigration.

“All 13 teams have been granted the National Licence for the 2025–2026 cycle by the FIB, while Brunei received special approval from the International Football Federation (FIFA) and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) to rejoin the Malaysian League this season," said MFL in a statement.
