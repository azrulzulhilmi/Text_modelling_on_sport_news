Razif Sidek now out of danger, expected to be discharged soon

KUALA LUMPUR: Badminton legend Datuk Razif Sidek is on the mend after being hospitalised with pneumonia, according to his brother, Datuk Rashid Sidek.

Razif, who captained Malaysia to the 1992 Thomas Cup title, was admitted on June 11 after experiencing breathing difficulty and was later diagnosed with pneumonia.

"He's still in hospital and under observation," Rashid told Timesport on Sunday.

"But he's doing much better than when he was first admitted on Wednesday. He needs to finish his course of antibiotics. If all goes well, he could be discharged soon."

The 63-year-old had just returned from a short family holiday in Australia.

It's believed the cold winter air Down Under may have triggered his illness.

Razif and his brother, Datuk Seri Jalani Sidek, were once ranked world No.1.

Their illustrious careers included winning the 1982 All England men's doubles title.

The pair also made history as Malaysia's first Olympic medallists, claiming bronze at the 1992 Barcelona Games.

They bagged two World Championship medals â€” silver in 1987 (Beijing) and bronze in 1989 (Jakarta).

While no longer coaching full-time, Razif remains an influential figure in the local badminton scene and is known for his outspoken takes on national players' performances.

His son, Fazriq Razif, is currently part of the national men's doubles squad, partnering Bryan Goonting.
