Club chairman Syed Yazid Syed Omar said several more players were under consideration as they would continue to rebuild.

“We are committed to building a complete structure from top to bottom. This is not just about a season - it’s about shaping a long-term identity for Kuala Lumpur,” said Yazid.

“We are looking at Filipino international goalkeeper Quincy Kammeraad, experienced centreback Adam Nor Azlin, and seasoned rightback Azrif Nasrulhaq.

“Discussions are also ongoing with Johor Darul Ta’zim (JDT) for potential arrivals including Safawi Rasid, Manuel Hidalgo, and Syamer Kutty Abba.

Key players Paulo Josue and Giancarlo Gallifuoco remain under contract and are expected to play important roles in the upcoming season.

It is learnt that the club could also be recruiting Serbian coach Risto Vidakovic, to replace Croatian Miroslav Kuljanac.

They also have Datuk Shamrat Gupta stepping in to support the day-to-day operations as executive director as a replacement for Stanley Bernard Samuel, who is currently with the national team set-up as the chief executive officer.
