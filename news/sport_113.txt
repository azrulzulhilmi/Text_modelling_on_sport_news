Keeper keeps flame burning

PETALING JAYA: Veteran goalkeeper Khairul Fahmi Che Mat is embracing his 18th Super League season with the same hunger and humility that shaped his decorated career to prove a point.

The 36-year-old custodian, fondly known as Apek, will continue to don the Sabah colours, extending his stint with the Rhinos since joining them in 2022.

While many would consider slowing down at his age, Khairul remains deeply committed, not just to guarding the goalposts but also mentoring the next generation of Sabah goalkeepers.

“My performances last season were decent, but I still feel there are things I need to improve,” said Khairul.

Having debuted in the Super League in 2009 with Kelantan, Khairul has now chalked up 17 top-flight seasons, with more than 400 club appearances and 61 caps for the national team under his belt.

Khairul believes the time is ripe for Sabah to push even further although they have enjoyed a steady rise in recent years. They have finished third in the Super League for three consecutive seasons.

“We saw the resurgence of Sabah in last three seasons. Teams don’t look down on us anymore, they’re on their toes. That shows our growth.

“We want to show we belong among the top and build on this momentum.”

The seasoned keeper credits the positive environment surrounding the team, from the facilities to the fan support, as key to their progress.

“We have a good stadium, strong training facilities, and players are happy. The fans have been amazing, and I’m happy to be part of all this.”

With a realistic view of his playing time at this stage of his career, Khairul acknowledges the healthy competition from teammates like Damien Lim but remains ready to fight for a place in the starting XI.

“My longevity is limited, but I know I can still give my best. Damien is a quality keeper, and I’ve got no issues with competing for a spot. What’s most important is what’s best for the team,” he said.

But Khairul’s role is not confined to just stopping goals, he’s embracing the chance to shape the future of Sabah’s goalkeeping department.

“As a veteran now, I want to guide the younger goalkeepers. We’ve got two from the Under-23 team with us now, and I aim to help them in training and during matches, coaching them by sharing my knowledge and motivating them.”

Khairul also praised the club’s latest imports, Australian midfielder Dean Pelekanos and New Zealand international wingback Dane Ingham, for integrating quickly with the team.

“Dean and Dane are adapting well. We’ve welcomed them and made sure they feel like they’re part of a family here.”

As he prepares for yet another season between the posts, Khairul remains driven, not by records or milestones, but by a deep desire to see Sabah succeed.

“Three seasons finishing third is good, but we want more. We want to do better this year, for the club, for the fans, and for Sabah.”
