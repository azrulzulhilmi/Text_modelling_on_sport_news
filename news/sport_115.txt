Brundo ready to serve Penang like a soldier

PETALING JAYA: Defender Stefano Brundo isn’t just bringing his experience to Penang, but also his heart, hunger and humility.

The 32-year-old Argentine, a familiar name in Malaysian football due to his exploits with Pahang, has officially joined the Panthers and has wasted no time embracing the island club’s ambition and ethos under coach Wan Rohaimi Wan Ismail.

And Brundo has described himself as a “soldier of the team”, ready to give everything, in any position.

“I’m here to serve. Whether it’s centreback or midfield, I will do anything the coach demands of me. I am the soldier,” said Brundo.

“Coach Wan Rohaimi has been very approachable and kind. I admire his ethics and intensity. He expects the best from every player, and that’s something I respect deeply.”

The decision to sign with Penang came down to a compelling project and an invigorating environment, both on and off the pitch.

“I was drawn by their proposal. The club are aiming big this season,” said Brundo.

“The last few years might not have been the best, but this season feels different. There’s ambition to bounce back and achieve great things in the Super League and the cup competitions.

Yet, the move wasn’t without its emotional farewells. Brundo’s departure from Pahang was a difficult one, a club where he felt a strong connection with the fans and community.

“It was really tough to leave Pahang. I had the best of times there and received a huge amount of love from the people,” he shared.

“My gratitude will always be with them, and I genuinely hope they compete strongly this season and the next. They are amazing, and I know that someday, somehow, our paths will cross again.”

For now, Brundo is fully focused on helping Penang forge a new chapter.
