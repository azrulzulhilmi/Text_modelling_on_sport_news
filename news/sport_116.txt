An A for courage
PETALING JAYA: Johor Darul Ta’zim (JDT) sensation Arif Aiman Hanapi may be Malaysia’s most valuable footballer, but the gifted winger knows that status means little when it comes to earning a spot in the national team’s starting eleven.

With the recent influx of new heritage and homegrown talents under coach Peter Cklamovski, the 23-year-old, who has won the Malaysian Football League (MFL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) award for four consecutive times since 2021, has embraced the heightened competition not with fear, but with determination.

“The new players have really helped us,” said Arif.

“As for me, it looks like I have to keep competing to be better. I will fight to keep my spot in the first eleven. Wherever I am, that is the motto.”

Arif’s response reflects the evolving mindset in the Harimau Malaya camp, one that thrives on meritocracy and collective growth.

Despite not finding the net in the recent matches, the JDT star still played a pivotal role, registering two assists and showcasing his trademark creativity and composure on the ball.

“As for my performance, maybe I didn’t score but everything that you saw on the pitch was the result of teamwork.”

Last season he scored 13 goals and provided 14 assists in 31 matches in domestic competitions, he has also made his mark in the AFC Champions League Elite where he netted five goals with two assists.

Known for his dribbling flair and intelligence in the final third, Arif’s humility and team-first mentality have made him a key figure not just for JDT but also in Malaysia’s attacking unit and a role model for younger players.

But he insists that the team must not rest on their laurels.

“This must continue. We now know what is needed to raise our standards. We must get better.”

With a growing pool of talent and a player like Arif willing to raise his game further, Harimau Malaya look poised to make a real statement in the Asian football scene.
