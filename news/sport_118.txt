Sarjit to quit if Malaysia fails to qualify for World Cup next year

2:15 PM MYT
PETALING JAYA: Sarjit Singh has set a significant target for himself: qualify for the World Cup next year or step down.

The national hockey team head coach stated he would resign if the team fails to qualify for the 2026 World Cup in Holland-Belgium next August and will accept full responsibility.

Sarjit mentioned he has the support of the Malaysian Hockey Confederation (MHC) since taking charge in March last year but will leave if he feels unable to continue.

“If I think I can’t do the job, and if we don’t qualify for the World Cup next year, I will resign.

“Don’t condemn the players. I will take responsibility,” he said.

His comments followed the Speedy Tigers' 1-2 loss against Wales in the Nations Cup classification match, leaving them sixth out of eight teams on home soil at the National Hockey Stadium in Bukit Jalil on Saturday (June 21).
