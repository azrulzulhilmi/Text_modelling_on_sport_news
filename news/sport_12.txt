World-class sparring could be singles' winning shot, says Jonassen

KUALA LUMPUR: The BA of Malaysia (BAM) may open its doors to world-class talent in a bid to fast-track the revival of its struggling singles department.

Coaching director Kenneth Jonassen believes that exposing national players to elite-level sparring partners — including the likes of world No. 2 Anders Antonsen — is crucial to bridging the gap with the world's best.

"Training alongside players like Antonsen gives our players a real sense of the level they must reach — technically, tactically and mentally," said Jonassen.

"Antonsen was here four weeks ago to prepare for the Singapore Open last month, and the experience was invaluable. We want to create more of these opportunities."

Among those who gained from the sessions with Antonsen were Ng Tze Yong, Leong Jun Hao and Justin Hoh, who all have been inconsistent this year.

Jonassen, however, has come under scrutiny recently following his shuttlers' early exits at the Malaysia Masters last month.

On Friday, BAM president Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz acknowledged the recent success of national doubles pairs but stressed that more attention was needed in singles.

Despite inconsistent progress since taking over in January, Jonassen remains adamant that long-term planning is the only way forward.

"Everything we do here is one long preparation for the future. We cannot train only at the level we are currently at because when the time comes to step up, we may find ourselves unprepared. That slows down the learning process," he said.

Jonassen also admitted that women's singles, in particular, has seen rapid evolution, with top players now blending physical ability with tactical acumen.

"The best women's singles players can both create and counter points. That's something we need to incorporate into our daily training," said the Dane, who has been tasked with reshaping Malaysia's singles programme.

"It's not just about practising for where we are now. It's about preparing to become someone who can challenge the very best. We need to practise what is required at the highest level.

"The complexity of winning points is not simply about hitting winners. Sometimes you need to outsmart your opponent, to change tactics mid-match.

"As our players rise through the world rankings, they will face opponents with these capabilities. If they've never encountered or trained for it, it becomes very difficult to win."

He also said that while the men's singles department has no shortage of raw talent, consistency remains a major issue.

"Training harder is important, but we must also train smarter — replicating the pressure, pace, and intensity of real tournaments in daily sessions," he added.
