Xin Yee hopes her idols Pearly-Thinaah stay with BAM

KUALA LUMPUR: Rising women's doubles shuttler Ong Xin Yee has her eyes firmly set on a dream debut at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and is looking to her idols Pearly Tan-M. Thinaah for inspiration.

Xin Yee, 19, and partner Carmen Ting are ranked world No. 42 and are making steady progress.

The pair have already gained valuable experience playing in top-tier tournaments, including Super 500 and Super 1000 events.

Their best showing this year came at last week's Super 1000 Indonesia Open, where they reached the second round — a result that has left the teenager pleasantly surprised.

"I didn't expect to reach this level so fast after juniors," said Xin Yee.

"But watching and sparring with seniors like Pearly-Thinaah really motivates us."

World No. 3 Pearly-Thinaah continue to train under the BA of Malaysia (BAM) banner, despite uncertainties surrounding their future.

Their previous contracts expired in December, and although negotiations remain at a standstill, BAM has continued paying their salaries — an indication that both parties may yet find common ground.

Xin Yee, meanwhile, remains grateful for their guidance.

"Pearly-Thinaah are my idols. We see them win titles like the Thailand Open, and we get inspired to follow in their footsteps," she said.

"It's very exciting to train and play with the top players as we can learn a lot from them."

Asked if she hopes the senior pair remain under BAM to continue mentoring the next generation, Xin Yee didn't hesitate: "Of course!"

With her sights on LA 2028, the teenager remains grounded, choosing to take things one step at a time.

"Of course, qualifying for the Olympics is my dream, but I try not to think too far ahead or stress too much.

"If I can, I want to play — that's always been the dream."

Xin Yee-Carmen are now hoping to break into the world's top 32 by December — a breakthrough that could open the door to higher-level tournaments and a smoother Olympic qualifying path.

While acknowledging that there's still a gap between them and the world's elite, Xin Yee is determined to bridge it.

"Our ability and standard aren't quite the same yet, but we're chasing the top pairs and hope to be like them one day."

With top role models, growing exposure, and a clear dream in mind, Xin Yee is on the right track in her Olympic pursuit.
