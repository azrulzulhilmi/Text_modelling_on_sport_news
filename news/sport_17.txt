Razif Sidek recovering well from pneumonia

KUALA LUMPUR: Datuk Razif Sidek, who captained Malaysia to the 1992 Thomas Cup title, is showing encouraging signs of recovery from pneumonia at a hospital in Kuala Lumpur.

Razif's former coach and close friend, Datuk James Selvaraj, said the 61-year-old was in high spirits during a visit on Friday.

"Razif's condition has improved a lot compared to the first two days, when he had some breathing difficulty. He was cheerful, laughing and joking when I visited him today," said James.

"He is still on intravenous antibiotics as the pneumonia is quite severe, so he'll need to remain warded for another week.

"His blood pressure and sugar levels are stable, and it's great to see him back to his jovial self."

James's relationship with the Sidek family goes back decades.

He was the one who first spotted the brothers' talent while they were training under their father, Datuk Sidek Kamar, in Kanchong Darat, Banting.

Razif and his younger brother, Datuk Seri Jalani Sidek, were also under James's tutelage when he served as assistant to national coach Datuk Tan Yee Khan in 1992, the year they won the All England title.

Razif, once world No 1 with Jalani, enjoyed a glittering career that included winning a silver medal at the 1987 World Championships.

Razif-Jalani also claimed Malaysia's first Olympic medal with bronze at the 1992 Barcelona Games.

Though no longer coaching actively, Razif remains closely involved in local badminton and is known for his candid views on the performances of national shuttlers.

His son, Fazriq Razif, is currently part of the national men's doubles set-up and partners Bryan Goonting.
