Bitten Vietnam to do the same as Harimau?

KUALA LUMPUR: Harimau Malaya have changed their stripes, so can the Golden Star Warriors?

It is learnt that Vietnam could fight fire with fire against Malaysia by strengthening their national team with naturalised players.

Coach Kim Sang Sik and the Vietnamese FA are said to be looking into getting more naturalised players.

The Southeast Asian powerhouse currently have several naturalised players in their ranks with Dang Van Lam, Filip Nguyen, Jason Quang Vinh and Nguyen Xuan Son. But that may be deemed not enough and Vietnam could be adding more, just like Malaysia.

Football critic Dr Zulakbal Abdul Karim, who did his Pro A licence in Vietnam and has friends in the Vietnam football system, said: "We talk often and it looks like Vietnam are looking to follow Malaysia and Indonesia's method to get heritage players from aboard.

"After playing against Malaysia's A-grade heritage players, Vietnam are impressed by the instant impact, and they are looking to do the same."

Malaysia, with the help of seven heritage players, shocked Vietnam 4-0 in an Asian Cup qualifier at Bukit Jalil last week.

But Vietnam may be prompted to recruit more naturalised players for the return leg in Hanoi in March next year to improve their chances of beating Malaysia.

"This is normal in football where people will try to imitate and apply it to their own team. The key is we need to be ready for it.

"We beat Vietnam with our element of surprise with the players' quality. They might do the same in the return tie.

"The Malaysia-Vietnam match is only next year, there's plenty of time for them to improve and we need to be ready for it."
