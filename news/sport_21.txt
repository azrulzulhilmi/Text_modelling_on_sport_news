Zii Jia attempts to get back up to world top 10

KUALA LUMPUR: There is good news for Lee Zii Jia's fans as the independent shuttler is set to make a return to competition at the Japan Open on July 15-20.

Zii Jia's world ranking has dropped to outside the top 20, after just playing in two tournaments this year following a right ankle injury at the World Tour Finals in December.

Currently ranked No. 21, Zii Jia last played in the All England in March where he lost in the first round, and subsequently withdrew from the Badminton Asian Championships in China in April to recover from the injury.

While Zii Jia's condition is still uncertain, he needs to start competing to get quality warm-up before the World Championships in Paris on Aug 25-31.

The Japan and China Open (July 22-27) are the only two big events before the World Championships.

Zii Jia's return coincides with the extended absence of national shuttler Ng Tze Yong who has ruptured his right anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) which requires surgery. The injury is set to rule out the national shuttler for up to a year.

It will be Tze Yong's second lengthy layoff after two back surgeries floored him for 14 months since January last year.

The Japan Open men's singles will attract a world class field except for world N0. 9 Viktor Axelsen of Denmark who is recovering from a back surgery.

Meanwhile the Japan Open will also see mixed doubles world No. 13 Hoo Pang Ron-Cheng Si Yin return to competition after missing the last three tournaments.

An ankle injury to Si Yin saw the national pair withdraw from the Malaysia Masters, Singapore and Indonesia Opens.

Fortunately, they were able to maintain their ranking and will be hoping to improve on their performance after managing only quarter-final spots in just two tournaments — the Orleans and Indonesia Masters — this year.
