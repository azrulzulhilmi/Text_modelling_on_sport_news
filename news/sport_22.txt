$mash and carry Pearly-Thinaah

KUALA LUMPUR: Women's doubles Pearly Tan-M. Thinaah may not rival their counterparts, Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik in prize money winnings, but they have pocketed a sizeable amount too.

Pearly-Thinaah have already pocketed RM614,511 from the World Tour in the first half of this year alone.

They earned the hundreds of thousands from 10 tournaments with the biggest purse coming from last week's Indonesia Open where they took home US$50,750 (RM214,670. Earlier in the year, they earned RM158,689 for their Thailand Open triumph.

Their other winnings came from the Indonesia Masters (RM76,368, second place) and India Open (RM56,275, semi-finals).

However, the narrow defeat (23-25, 21-12, 21-19) to China's world No. 1 Liu Sheng Shu-Tang Ning in the Indonesia Open final saw Pearly-Thinaah miss the

RM453,478 first prize.

Money aside, Pearly-Thinaah also achieved a career high world No. 3 ranking by moving up a spot this week.

Remarkably, Pearly-Thinaah's winnings this season even outstripped current men's doubles world No. 1 Goh Sze Fei-Nur Izzuddin Rumsani who have earned RM427,849 from eight tournaments this year.

World No. 2 Aaron-Wooi Yik raked in RM818,912 in total prize money from 10 tournaments and won three titles.

Pearly-Thinaah will resume their hunt for more honours and money at the Japan Open from July 15-20 which offers RM265,782 for the women's doubles top prize.
