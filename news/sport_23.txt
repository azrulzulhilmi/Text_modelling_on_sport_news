Badminton coach Iskandar leaving Ireland for Malaysia?

KUALA LUMPUR: Former national shuttler Iskandar Zulkarnain Zainuddin is in the frame to fill the vacant position of national women's singles coach.

BAM singles coaching director Kenneth Jonassen feels that Iskandar could be a valuable addition to the national set-up.

But the Dane stopped short of naming him as the frontrunner to replace Indonesian Jeffer Rosobin who resigned in February.

Iskandar joined Badminton Ireland in 2021 as a sparring partner, but has transitioned into the role of singles coach.

The 33-year-old said during last month's Malaysia Masters that BAM had approached him earlier this year on a coaching role.

However, Iskandar remained non-committal then as his family were residing in Ireland.

Jonassen acknowledged that Iskandar's experience makes him a strong candidate, but said BAM is still looking at several prospects.

"I can't confirm if he's on the shortlist, but of course, he's an experienced coach, someone who would certainly be a good fit for our set-up," said Jonassen.
