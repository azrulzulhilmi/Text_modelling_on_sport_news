Dehydrated Elsa still doubtful for BJKC clash

KUALA LUMPUR: It is still unknown whether national tennis player Elsa Wan Abdul Rahman can recover in time to play in Malaysia's next Billie Jean King Cup (BJKC) Asia-Oceania Group II tie against Mongolia tomorrow (June 18).

Elsa suffered from dehydration after her heroic efforts in Malaysia's 2-1 win over Kyrgyzstan in Group A at the National Tennis Centre yesterday (June 16).

The 21-year-old was ill and vomited a number of times throughout yesterday but still took to court for the singles and doubles (with Lim Zan Ning) and won both her matches.

Malaysia has been given a rest day for today and will face Mongolia, the top seeds, tomorrow. The latter have not lost a match in the tournament so far.

National team captain Koay Hao Sheng said Elsa has yet to fully recover.

"We took her to the clinic yesterday and was told that she was dehydrated as she had vomited a number of times," said Hao Sheng today.

"She has been resting since yesterday and I believe is about 70 per cent recovered.

"I am not sure if she can play tomorrow, we will assess her condition during our training session this evening.

"On a positive note, Hannah Yip has shown some improvement during our training session this morning.

"At the moment we do not know which players we will be playing tomorrow. Whoever is playing will have to give it their best."

Doubles specialist Hannah has been battling a hip injury. Hao Sheng can make changes to his start list up to 30 minutes before the match starts.

In group A today (June 17), Mongolia routed Singapore 3-0 while Kyrgyzstan downed Northern Mariana Islands by the same scoreline.

In group B, second seeds Indonesia edged Pacific Oceania 2-1 while Philippines defeated Uzbekistan 2-1.

Order of play for tomorrow (June 17)
