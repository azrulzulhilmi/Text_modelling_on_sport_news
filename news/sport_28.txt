UCI centre set to put BMX development in full 'wheel'

KUALA LUMPUR: BMX cycling in Malaysia is set for a major boost with the establishment of the UCI World Cycling Centre (WCC) Satellite in Johor Bahru.

UCI, the sport's world governing body, has approved the development of a Continental Development Satellite and Regional Development Satellite WCC centre specifically for BMX.

Asian Cycling Confederation (ACC) president Datuk Amarjit Singh Gill , who also heads the Malaysian National Cycling Federation (MNCF), hailed the move as a breakthrough for both Malaysia and the region.

"The WCC BMX Johor Bahru will work closely with the UCI WCC headquarters in Aigle, Switzerland," said Amarjit.

"It will play a vital role in the development of cycling and serve as a centre of sporting excellence for national federations."

Amarjit revealed that this recognition comes after years of lobbying.

"I am very pleased with this approval. It's been MNCF's long struggle since 2014. After multiple meetings with the WCC director and UCI president, Malaysia have finally received its biggest recognition from UCI."

Malaysia are now the fourth Asian nation to host a UCI WCC satellite facility, joining South Korea (Seoul), China (Shanghai), and Japan (Shizuoka).

The centre will be run in partnership with the Johor State Government, Johor State Sports Council and the Johor State Cycling Association (PBNJ), alongside MNCF.

"Convincing UCI was a major milestone and an excellent starting point for the development of BMX in Southeast Asia," said Amarjit.

"Countries like Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines have many talented BMX riders.

"With the WCC BMX Johor Bahru, I believe Malaysia will also reap significant benefits."
