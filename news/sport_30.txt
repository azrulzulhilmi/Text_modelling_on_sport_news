Aliana back on track after injury woes

KUALA LUMPUR: National track rider Aliana Azizan, who suffered multiple injuries in a crash last year, is expected to make a full comeback at the international level next season.

National track cycling team head coach Harnizam Basri said he was pleased with both Aliana's performances as well as her confidence on the bike at the recent National Championships in Johor.

It was her first race since suffering a fractured rib and a concussion in a local race in October last year.

"She only trained for a month before the National Championships so to achieve what she did was quite impressive," said Harnizam recently.

"Before that (one month period) she did not train on the bike. She would feel dizzy (due to effects of concussion) after doing gym work so we did not want to risk her losing her balance on the bike and crashing.

"She has, however, improved a lot now and looks confident on the bike.

"She is determined to regain her spot in the women's team sprint squad. We gave her spot to another rider when she was recovering.

"Our goal is to prepare her for what will be a busy season next year. We will, however, be careful to monitor her condition to make sure she does not get injured.

"We are hoping to see her race in the UCI Nations Cup as well as the Commonwealth and Asian Games next year."

Aliana, who turns 22 next month, finished third in the women's individual sprint behind Izzah (gold) and Yong Ann Tung (silver) as well as silver in the 1 kilometre time trial behind Izzah at the National Championships in Johor.

Harnizam disclosed that Aliana has been working hard to improve her strength and has increased from 54 kilogrammes to 60kg which is a positive sign.
