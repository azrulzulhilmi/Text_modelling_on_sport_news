MPC dominate to win national team time trial title

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia Pro Cycling (MPC) left no room for drama as they clinched a comfortable victory in the men's team time trial event at the National Road Cycling Championships in Johor today.

MPC's Faiz Fakhri Omar, Ariff Danial Roseidi, Akmal Hakim Zakaria and Zahin Wahhi stopped the clock at one hour, six minutes and 5.709 seconds (48.45km/h average) to take the gold.

Police's Elmi Jumari, Shaiful Adlan Shukri and brothers Ameer and Ameen Ahmad Kamal took second place (1:07:27.303s) while Aquatwo Cyclomotion (Iqmal Mohd Zarawi, Nasrul Firas Ridzuan and Zamirul Azrezza Zulkefli) finished third on 1:11:14.338s.

The 53.4km course started and ended at Kolej Vokasional Pagoh in Muar.

Heavyweights Terengganu Cycling Team (TSG), however, opted not to compete in the event.

MPC team principal Sayuti Zahit said it was a positive start for his squad, who are only competing in their second edition of the national championships since the team was founded in late 2023.

"This is the first time they (national body) have included the team time trial in the national championships. I believe it is part of our preparations for the Thailand Sea Games this year," said Sayuti when contacted in Pagoh today.

"We assumed TSG would race but they chose not to compete.

"But still, it was a solid performance from our boys. Police had some good riders in their team, including the Ahmad Kamal brothers who are former Sea Games gold medallists.

"We only used road bikes instead of time trial bikes so to get 48km/h average is a good achievement.

"It has been a positive start for us here and we hope to continue racing well in the individual time trial and road race."

The men's and women's individual time trial events will be held tomorrow (May 30) while the men's and women's mass start road races will be held on Sunday (June 1).
