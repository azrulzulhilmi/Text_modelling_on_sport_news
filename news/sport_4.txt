Arif Aiman proves locals can still shine, says ex-Harimau

KUALA LUMPUR: Former national defender S. Subramaniam has hailed Arif Aiman Hanapi as the gold standard for Malaysian-born players striving to make their mark amid the flood of imports and naturalised stars in local football.

Rather than seeing the influx as a threat, Subramaniam views it as a challenge and a wake-up call for local talent to raise their game.

"During my time, the competition wasn't as fierce. Now, players are up against 15 imports per team and more naturalised players in the national squad. But that's no excuse," said Subramaniam, who won seven caps for Malaysia between 2008 and 2012.

"Just look at Arif Aiman, he's the benchmark. He's shown that local boys can still lead the national team."

The Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT) star stole the show in Harimau Malaya's 4-0 thrashing of Vietnam in the Asian Cup qualifiers last week, underlining his status as the face of Harimau Malaya.

Still only 23, Arif has delivered consistently over the past few seasons.

In the 2024-2025 Asian Champions League Elite, he notched five goals and two assists in 10 appearances.

On the domestic front, he racked up 15 goals and 13 assists and was named M-League Most Valuable Player for a fourth time.

Subramaniam, who was part of Kelantan's golden era with back-to-back league titles in 2011 and 2012 and Malaysia Cup wins in 2010 and 2012, believes Arif's rise is proof the grassroots system still works if managed properly.

"Four-time MVP, still so young, and delivering season after season, and this is no fluke," he said.

"It shows that our development pipeline can still produce stars if done right."

Now coaching at Melaka FC, Subramaniam urged young Malaysians to stop making excuses and start grinding.

"It's all about mindset and discipline. You've got to put in double the work, be brave, and take on challenges head-on. The chances might be fewer, but they're still there."
