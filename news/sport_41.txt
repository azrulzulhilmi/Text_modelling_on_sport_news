Syazrin clinches hard-earned stage win at Yellow River International

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia Pro Cycling's (MPC) Ahmad Syazrin Awang Illah claimed his maiden international race win on the road with the team in the third stage of the Along the Yellow River International in China today (May 20).

Syazrin timed his move well in the bunch sprint to hit the line first, clocking two hours and three minutes flat. Iranian Mahdi Nateghi and Ukrainian Vitalii Novakovskyi finished second and third in the 98km stage in Xinxiang.

It was a positive result for Syazrin who had previously made a name for himself in mountain biking (MTB).

He won gold in MTB at the 2021 Hanoi Sea Games and multiple Asian Championship medals in the discipline in recent years.

Syazrin was roped in to MPC when the team was formed in 2023 and team principal Sayuti Zahit has been working hard to mould him into a formidable sprinter.

"Alhamdulillah, this is our first podium here and what makes it even more special is that Syazrin won it for us," said Sayuti when contacted in China today.

"We have been able to successfully transform Syazrin into a strong sprinter on the road. It has been a challenging journey for him and it has taken about a year to really bear fruit."

It was MPC's second stage in the space of a month as Zahin Wahhi had won stage six of the MPTC Tour of Luzon recently.

The other MPC riders competing in China are Akmal Hakim Zakaria, Fahmi Khairul, Faheem Zaini, Ariff Roseidi and Zulfikri Zulkifli.
