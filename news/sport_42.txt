Mirabel, Jeneath to lead Malaysia's charge at Sea Games

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia are banking on Mirabel Ting and Jeneath Wong to sustain their gold medal streak at the Sea Games in Thailand in December.

The Malaysian Golf Association (MGA) is confident that with both US-based aces back in the fold, the women's team will once again be in the hunt for top honours, as the nation target a third straight Sea Games triumph.

Mirabel has been a revelation in the US collegiate scene this season.

The Florida State University standout bagged five individual titles and capped her season by becoming the first Asian to win the prestigious Annika Award, given to the best NCAA Division I female golfer.

She's also scaled new heights on the world stage, currently ranked No. 2 on the World Amateur Golf Ranking (WAGR) — the highest ever for a Malaysian.

Jeneath, representing Pepperdine University, may not have matched Mirabel's accolades this season, but carved her own slice of history by winning the Women's Amateur Asia-Pacific (WAAP) in Vietnam in March — the first Malaysian to do so in the prestigious championship.

MGA president Tan Sri Anwar Nor knows their presence could prove decisive.

"Having both Mirabel and Jeneath available again will boost our medal hopes tremendously. A podium finish is almost certain, but whether we can win gold depends on how we fare against the Thais, who will be very strong at home," said Anwar.

Thailand are expected to assemble a formidable line-up led by US-based stars Eila Galitsky and Suvichaya Vinijchaitham, with the timing of the Games — during the winter break in the US college season — allowing countries to field their strongest squads.

The Philippines are also expected to unleash world No. 6 Rianne Malixi, adding further depth to an already competitive women's field.

Mirabel and Jeneath last played together at the 2021 Hanoi Sea Games, combining for silver in the team event.

Jeneath also secured an individual bronze.

The duo were absent in Phnom Penh, Cambodia in 2023 after being unable to get clearance from respective schools, but Malaysia still walked away with a gold medal through homegrown hero Ng Jing Xuen in the women's individual event.

Jing Xuen, Foong Zi Yu, and Geraldine Wong also claimed a bronze in the team event.

This year, Thailand will revert the team format back to stroke play — first introduced at the 2017 KL Games — an option within their rights as hosts.

Anwar admitted it may favour the hosts but believes the Malaysians are up to the challenge.

"Mirabel and Jeneath are capable of delivering because only the two best individual counting scores will contribute to the team result. If they are at the top of their game, we're right in contention with the Thais," he said.

While the women's team carry stronger expectations, Malaysia's men are also shaping up well.

Anson Yeo and Nathan Tsen, fresh off a 1–2 finish at the PGM Tour's Tun Ahmad Sarji Trophy last month, have shown they're capable of competing and beating seasoned pros.

Even in Cambodia, Malaysia's men delivered beyond expectations.

Malcolm Ting, Mirabel's elder brother, stepped up in the absence of more fancied US-based duo Marcus Lim and K. Rhaasrikanesh to win a surprise silver in the men's individual event.

Malaysia's campaign in Hanoi 2022 produced a two-gold, one-silver, one-bronze haul, led by Ervin Chang's double gold in the individual and team events, with strong support from Marcus and Rhaasrikanesh.

Jing Xuen then kept the momentum going with her golden feat in 2023.

However, she won't be returning to defend her title this time, having turned professional last year.
