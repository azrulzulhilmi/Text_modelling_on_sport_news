World No. 2 Mirabel to defend title at TSM Golf Challenge

KUALA LUMPUR: The TSM Golf Challenge, one of the nation's premier junior amateur tournaments, is set to return for its 14th edition from June 16-19 at the Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club (KLGCC), with national No. 1 amateurs Mirabel Ting and Anson Yeo leading the field.

For the first time, the tournament will be held biennially, as announced last year. A total of 85 players — 50 boys and 35 girls under the age of 21 — will compete in this invitation-only event.

The top 10 finishers in both categories will be awarded academic scholarships worth a combined RM133,000.

The previous edition in 2023, also held at KLGCC, saw Mirabel claim the women's title while Marcus Lim emerged as the men's champion.

Mirabel, currently home on summer break after a standout year at Florida State University, has confirmed her participation to defend her crown.

Marcus, however, will not be returning as he has since turned professional.

This will mark Mirabel's first tournament on home soil since the Maybank Championship last October.

She enters as the clear favourite, now ranked No. 2 on the World Amateur Golf Ranking (WAGR) — a historic achievement as the highest-ever ranking for a Malaysian golfer, male or female.

Mirabel recently added another feather to her cap by becoming the first Asian recipient of the prestigious Annika Award, presented annually to the top female golfer in the NCAA Division I circuit.

She captured four collegiate titles during the 2024-25 season and wrapped up the year with a runner-up finish at the NCAA Division I Women's Golf Championship last month.

A successful title defence would also make Mirabel the first player to do so at the TSM Golf Challenge since Galven Green achieved the feat in 2014 and 2015.

Held under the tagline "In Search of the Malaysian Tiger", the TSM Golf Challenge has played a key role in shaping Malaysia's top golfing talents.

Past champions include Gavin Green, Kelly Tan and Ashley Lau.

Gavin and Ashley are currently the national No. 1 professionals, competing on the DP World Tour and Epson Tour respectively, while Kelly held the mantle as Malaysia's sole LPGA Tour representative for nearly a decade until last year.

All three have also proudly represented Malaysia at the Olympic Games.

"This event is more than a golf tournament — it's a national movement," said Datuk Mustapha Buang, president of the Tan Sri Muhyiddin Charity Golf Foundation.

"We are committed to creating real, sustainable impact by investing in young Malaysians. This year, we return with a stronger, more inclusive platform that reinforces our core mission."
