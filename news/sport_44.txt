Speedy Tigresses tamed by South Africa

KUALA LUMPUR: Coach Nasihin Nubli is satisfied with Malaysia's performance despite the Speedy Tigresses going down 3-1 to South Africa in the Nations Cup Two in Walcz, Poland yesterday.

Dayang Nuramirah Abang Mahadini gave Malaysia the lead in the 11th minute, but South Africa hit back with three goals in 10 minutes through Ntsopa Mokoena (39th), Onthatile Zulu (42nd) and Hannah Pearce (49th).

"I'm proud of the fighting spirit shown by my players against a strong team like South Africa who have featured in the Olympics," Nasihin said.

On Monday, Malaysia had lost 2-0 to hosts Poland in their Group A opener. This led to Malaysia's world ranking dropping one rung to 24.

After two defeats, Malaysia will play for fifth to eighth placing. Malaysia will wrap up their group fixtures tomorrow against a tough Uruguay who had defeated South Africa 2-0 and drew 1-1 with Poland.
