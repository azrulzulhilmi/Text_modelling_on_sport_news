Charlet hat-trick helps France into Nations Cup semis

KUALA LUMPUR: World No. 9 France sealed their place in the Nations Cup semi-finals after edging world No. 12 South Africa 4-3 for their second straight Group A win at the National Hockey Stadium in Bukit Jalil on Monday.

Victor Charlet was the hero for France, converting three penalty corners in the first, 35th and 44th minutes, while Xavier Esmenjaud added the other in the 58th minute.

South Africa replied through Jaydon Brooker (2nd, 59th) and Marvin Simons (59th), but it was not enough to stop the in-form French side.

France, who had edged world No. 15 South Korea 6-5 on Sunday, now lead Group A with six points from two matches.

Charlet, who stands at 1.96m and now leads the tournament scoring chart with five goals, was thrilled to score a hat-trick and believes France can go all the way.

"I believe we can win the Nations Cup here and qualify for the FIH Pro League," said the drag-flick specialist.

"Scoring goals is great, but this is not about personal glory, it's about doing it for my nation."

Meanwhile, South Korea kept their semi-final hopes alive with a narrow 3-2 win over world No. 18 Wales.

Korea now have three points from two matches and need a win over South Africa on Wednesday to book their place in the last four.

Wales, who drew 4-4 with South Africa in their opener, have just one point from two matches. They will complete the group stage against France.

The Koreans struck through Yang Jihun (44th), Lee Jungjun (45th) and Lim Dohyun (57th), while Gareth Furlong (30th) and Rhys Bradshaw (59th) replied for Wales.

South Korea coach Min Tae Seok was generally pleased but admitted penalty corner conversion needs improvement.

"We wasted too many penalty corners and must work on that before our next match.

"It's going to be tough against South Africa, but we'll prepare well. The African champions have good individual skills and are very dangerous inside the semi-circle."

Wales coach Daniel Newcombe was upbeat despite the loss.

"I think we played really well. But the game completely changed when Korea scored two quick goals.

After that, we were chasing the game. We still have a chance to reach the semi-finals and we'll go all out against France."
