Speedy Tigers roar back to hold Pakistan in Nations Cup

KUALA LUMPUR: Speedy Tigers twice clawed their way back to hold world No.15 Pakistan 3-3 in a thrilling Nations Cup Group B clash at the National Hockey Stadium on Sunday.

It was world No.13 Malaysia's ninth draw against the Green Shirts since the 1968 Mexico Olympics.

Pakistan, who came into the tournament without any warm-up matches, struck early through Ahmad Nadeem (sixth minute) and Abdul Rehman (ninth) while Ashraf Rana Waheed added a third in the 54th minute.

But Malaysia refused to back down, roaring back with three goals in the final 11 minutes through Fitri Saari (49th) and Syed Syafiq Syed Cholan (52nd, 56th).

National coach Sarjit Singh admitted his side were nervous, especially after a rain delay pushed back the start by over an hour.

"My players showed great spirit to come back from 2-0 and 3-2 down to earn a point," said Sarjit.

"We only played well in the third and fourth quarters, but I'm pleased with the players' work rate.

"Every match counts, and hopefully, we start stronger against New Zealand tomorrow."

Earlier, defending champions New Zealand edged Japan 2-1 after falling behind early.

Ryosuke Shinohara opened the scoring in the fifth minute, but the Black Sticks hit back immediately through Sam Hiha, before Dylan Thomas netted the winner in the 56th minute.
