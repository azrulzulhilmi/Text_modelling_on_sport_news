Korea's FC Seoul Phoenix get nod for A1 Semi Pro League

KUALA LUMPUR: The A1 Semi Pro League will feature South Korean side FC Seoul Phoenix for the 2025-2026 season.

Phoenix were one of the final four teams to complete the 16-club cast for the upcoming season.

The other three are Kedah Darul Aman FC (KDA FC), Guar Syed Alwi FC (GSA FC) and UM-Damansara United, who had previously been granted conditional approvals.

Amateur Football League (AFL) chairman Datuk Yusoff Mahadi said the three teams had submitted the required documents within the stipulated time frame to secure their places.

"Kedah Darul Aman FC, Guar Syed Alwi FC, and FC Seoul Phoenix have all been officially confirmed for the A1 Semi Pro League 2025-2026," said Yusoff in a statement today (June 16).

UM-Damansara United, who were initially placed on the waiting list alongside Ipoh City FC, also made the cut after successfully completing the vetting process.

"UM-Damansara United's participation has been confirmed, bringing the total number of competing teams to 16. However, Ipoh City FC have decided to withdraw from the competition," he added.

The AFL Board of Directors had earlier confirmed 12 clubs during their meeting on June 5, which includes returning sides such as Armed Forces FC, Manjung City FC, Imigresen FC II, Johor Darul Ta'zim II, Selangor FC II, Kelantan WTS FC and Kedah FA.

Also in the mix are Machan FC, Kelantan Red Warriors FC, Bunga Raya FC, Malaysian University and the Perak FA (PAFA).
