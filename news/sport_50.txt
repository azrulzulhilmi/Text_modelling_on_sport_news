Sarjit's men wary of Pakistan's drag flick threat in Nations Cup opener

KUALA LUMPUR: The Nations Cup marks the national men's hockey team's first tournament of the season, and Sarjit Singh's men will be eager to make a statement in front of their home fans.

World No. 13 Malaysia open their Group B campaign against former world and Olympic champions Pakistan (ranked No. 15) at the National Hockey Stadium in Bukit Jalil on Sunday. The other teams in the group are world No. 12 New Zealand and No. 16 Japan.

Sarjit is using the tournament as a key platform to assess his side ahead of the Asia Cup in August, which offers a World Cup spot to the champions.

The Speedy Tigers head into the competition in high spirits after strong preparations, including playing tours in Australia and South Korea.

In seven matches in Perth, Malaysia edged Western Australia 2-1, lost 6-0 to Australia A, and suffered 5-2, 4-1, and 6-1 defeats to the full-strength Australian national team, while managing a 4-4 draw in the final game.

Against world No. 14 South Korea, Malaysia impressed with back-to-back 4-1 wins, followed by two draws (5-5, 1-1) and a 4-2 defeat in the fifth and final encounter — scoring 16 goals and conceding 12 over five matches.

Malaysia have faced Pakistan 38 times since the 1968 Mexico Olympics, winning just five and drawing 13.

Last year, they lost 5-4 to the Green Shirts at the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup but held them to 4-4 and 2-2 draws at the Nations Cup and Asian Champions Trophy.

Malaysia's last victory over Pakistan came in the 2023 Asian Champions Trophy — a 3-1 win.

Pakistan, however, are no longer the powerhouse they once were, hampered by limited funding and development back home.

On Sunday, they'll be banking on star drag flicker Sufyan Khan, who has netted 24 goals in 48 matches since 2022.

The defender — who turned out for Matador Club in this year's Malaysia Hockey League, scoring 17 goals — also struck against Malaysia in all three meetings last year.

National captain Marhan Jalil admitted there's added pressure playing on home soil.

"There is always pressure playing in a tournament, but it's even more intense when you're at home," said Marhan.

"We need to play a disciplined game from the first whistle to the final hooter.

"The first match is key. A win would lift our motivation and improve our chances of reaching the semi-finals.

"We know Pakistan have a quality drag flicker in Sufyan, so we must avoid conceding penalty corners."

Pakistan coach Tahir Zaman is expecting a high-tempo clash.

"Malaysia are stronger on home ground. We're focused on playing good, disciplined hockey — that's our target," said Tahir.

"We want to play exciting, attractive hockey. Every team wants to win this tournament and so do we.

"We're not looking at past records. The game has changed, world rankings have changed. We just hope everything goes well for us tomorrow."

Meanwhile, Malaysia suffered a 3-0 defeat in a friendly against Wales at Bukit Jalil on Friday.
