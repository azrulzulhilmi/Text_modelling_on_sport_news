Sarjit calls up Danish after Hafizuddin's injury in Jincheon

KUALA LUMPUR: National men's hockey coach Sarjit Singh is concerned with the goalkeeping department as Malaysia prepare for the Nations Cup at Bukit Jalil from June 15-21.

First choice Hafizuddin Othman suffered a back injury during the five-match playing tour to Jincheon, South Korea from May 18-29.

Hafizuddin, who has 112 international caps, suffered the injury in the third friendly.

"Rafaizul Saini (ex-junior World Cupper) played in the fourth and fifth matches, but he was weak in defending penalty corners," said Sarjit.

"I am concerned about the goalkeeping department and have called up another goalkeeper, Danish Afnan Faizal (who played in the 2023 Junior World Cup)."

On the team's performance in Jincheon, Sarjit said: "Overall the players played well with a fast attacking game in all the five matches against the Koreans."

World No. 13 Malaysia beat world No. 14 South Korea with identical scores of 4-1 in the first two matches, but drew the next two 5-5 and 1-1 before losing 4-2 in the fifth.

The Speedy Tigers earned 23 penalty corners and converted five, while the Koreans converted five of 25 penalty corners.

Malaysia are drawn in Group B of the Nations Cup with world No. 12 New Zealand, Pakistan (No. 15) and Japan (No. 16). Group A consists of world No. 9 France, South Africa (No. 11), South Korea (No. 14) and Wales (No.18).
