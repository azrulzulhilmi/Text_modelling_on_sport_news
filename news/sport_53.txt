The Speedy Tigers, who went to South Korea to play five friendly matches in preparation for the Nations Cup in Bukit Jalil next month, won the first two matches with identical score of 4-1.

Meanwhile Malaysian Hockey Confederation president Datuk Seri Subahan Kamal said Malaysia must do well to encourage fans to come to the stadium for the Nations Cup.
