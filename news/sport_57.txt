KUALA LUMPUR: The Speedy Tigresses wrapped up their China tour with a 3-3 draw against Liaoning in their seventh and final friendly at the Gongshu Hockey Stadium on Saturday.

World No. 23 Malaysia found the net through Nur Afiqh Syahzani Azhar, Khairunnisa Ayuni Sharuddin and Azmyra Mia Sofea Azhari.

Nasihin Nubli's side, gearing up for the Nations Cup 2 in Poland from June 16-22, ended the series with one win (2-1), two draws (1-1 and 3-3) and three defeats (1-0, 3-1 and 2-0).

The result of the third match, played on May 10, was not disclosed by the Malaysia Hockey Confederation (MHC).

Excluding the undisclosed result, the national women's team scored seven goals and conceded 11 in six matches.

Liaoning, who are preparing for the China National Games, fielded a second-string side for most of the series due to national team call-ups.
