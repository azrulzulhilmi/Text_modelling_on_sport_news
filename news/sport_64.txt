Heartbreak for bowler Gillian at US Open

GILLIAN Lim came agonisingly close to a stepladder finals berth at the US Women's Open, but the debutant ultimately fell short by just 127 pins after completing 56 gruelling games in Lincoln, Nebraska.

The 26-year-old finished seventh overall with 11,784 pinfalls, including 14 wins from 24 match play games across three rounds of match play.

She contested eight games on Sunday, followed by two additional rounds totaling 16 games on Monday.

It marked her strongest performance yet at a PWBA major, reinforcing her emergence on the prestigious professional circuit.

Compatriot Natasha Roslan, the IBF World Cup winner in January, also held her own in a tough field, placing 14th with 11,628 pinfalls and a 12-12 win-loss record in match play.

For their efforts, Gillian pocketed US$8,600 (RM36,500) while Natasha took home US$5,600 (RM23,800).

The final five advancing to Tuesday's stepladder finals at Sun Valley Lanes are Americans Jordan Snodgrass (11,988), Lauren Russo (11,957), Crystal Elliot (11,948), Maryssa Carey (11,931), and Singapore's New Hui Fen (11,911).

The US Women's Open marked Gillian's seventh and final appearance of the season. It was commendable nevertheless, as she recorded four top-15 finishes.

Her seventh-place finish at the US Open followed a strong run of results, including a joint-fifth placing at the Rock 'n Roll Open and ninth at the Bowlers Journal Waterloo Open. Her other standout performance came at the PWBA Topeka Open, the season opener, where she finished 15th.

"For sure, there are lots of positives to take away and improve on. Slowly but surely, I'm getting there. I've learned a lot this week too," said Gillian.

"I definitely want to return next year. The experience has been really valuable, and I feel there's still so much room to grow. The PWBA format is quite different from the Open events in Asia — everything from the lane conditions to the structure and intensity is on another level."

Gillian, who achieved a rare Malaysia Open–National Championships double last year, will resume competition at the Thailand Open next month.
