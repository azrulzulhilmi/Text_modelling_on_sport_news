Homebois' mental strength still lacking, says coach

KUALA LUMPUR: Homebois coach Ervan "Erpang" Pratama stressed that his charges must improve their mental strength if they are to have any chance against the world's best at the Mid Season Cup x Esports World Cup (MSC x EWC) in Riyadh next month.

Homebois suffered a 4-0 defeat at the hands of Selangor Red Giants (SRG.OG) in the Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Professional League Malaysia (MPL MY) Season 15 Grand Finals on Sunday (June 15).

Ervan believes mental strength is what separated the two sides. Both SRG.OG and Homebois will compete at MSC x EWC.

"I feel that right now, mentally, we're not ready for MSC. But if we assess the team's progress in terms of gameplay, I believe we can still be competitive," he said.

"I don't agree that the gap (between SRG.OG and Homebois) in terms of gameplay is that wide. The real gap was in terms of mentality.

"We don't yet have the mentality that SRG.OG possesses. Their focus is already on an international level. Perhaps for Homebois, we are still at the MPL MY level.

"We need to build a champion's mentality â€” not just a 'we want to qualify for MSC' mentality, or a second-place mentality. We can't afford to think like that if we want to compete internationally."

Ervan rejected suggestions that his side had been completely outplayed in the Grand Final, pointing out that Homebois had opportunities to take control, particularly in the second and third games.

"During games two and three, I felt we had a chance to win, it's just that we didn't perform as we had hoped," he said.

Ervan remains optimistic his team has the potential to finish in the top four at MSC x EWC.
