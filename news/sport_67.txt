Gillian within striking distance of US Open stepladder finals

KUALA LUMPUR: Bowler Gillian Lim remained firmly in contention for a spot in the stepladder finals at the US Women's Open after delivering a solid performance in the first round of match play in Lincoln, Nebraska.

The 26-year-old sits seventh overall with a 40-game total of 8,204 pinfalls, just 46 pins shy of the current top-five cut heading into the final two match play rounds.

Gillian, who picked up five wins from eight matches on Sunday, will continue to carry Malaysia's hopes alongside Natasha Roslan, who is 12th with 8,141 pinfalls and four match wins.

Each win awards a 30-pin bonus, keeping both bowlers in the frame for a late push.

The top five after 56 games will qualify for Tuesday's televised stepladder finals at Sun Valley Lanes.

"It was a tough oiling pattern today," said Gillian.

"Probably ball changes and line adjustments need to be fast."

Unlike regular assignments with the national team, Gillian is navigating the PWBA Tour on her own, but she credited her equipment team for their on-site support.

"We've got ball representatives here with us. I'm with MOTIV, so they have specialists assigned to support professional bowlers during competitions like this," she explained.

"They help us with equipment, choosing the right ball for the lane condition, and also suggest where to play on the lane and when to make adjustments."

American Maryssa Carey leads the standings with 8,604, followed by Colombia's Rocio Restrepo (8,388), Lauren Russo (8,315), Jordan Snodgrass (8,299) and New Hui Fen of Singapore (8,250).

Earlier in the day, both Gillian and Natasha had advanced to the 24-woman match play round after finishing fourth and eighth respectively in the fourth and final qualifying block.

However, it was the end of the road for defending champion Sin Li Jane, who fell short in 30th place, while Nora Lyana Nastasia Norkamal concluded her campaign in 32nd.
