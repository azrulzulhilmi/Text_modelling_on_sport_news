Selangor Red Giants complete historic three-peat in MPL Malaysia

KUALA LUMPUR: Selangor Red Giants (SRG.OG) skipped Hari Raya Aidiladha celebrations and were rewarded with history.

The Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB) juggernaut made it three league titles in a row after dismantling Homebois 4-0 in the MPL Malaysia (MPL MY) Season 15 Grand Final at Juara Stadium, Bukit Kiara, on Sunday.

SRG.OG had edged Homebois 3-2 in a tense upper bracket final two weeks earlier, but there was no room for doubt in the final — just domination.

Coach Michael Angelo Bocado, better known as Arcadia, said the team were determined to make a statement.

"We wanted the sweep because the last time it was too close," said the Filipino coach.

"We set a goal to show that the gap is wide. The team trained hard over the past two weeks and made sacrifices, including giving up their Raya break, to achieve this.

"Even though we didn't play any matches before the final, we felt we had the momentum. I'm proud of how we performed, this is a glorious reward for our hard work."

SRG.OG became the first team to win three consecutive MPL Malaysia league titles, having already made history last season as the first to win back-to-back crowns.

Team co-founder Simon Lim lauded his players for bouncing back after their third-place finish at the M6 World Championships on home soil in December.

"After the disappointment of M6, the boys said they wanted to improve. They were willing to put in the extra hours," said Simon.

"This three-peat is a result of that hunger.

"But we're not done yet. We've got a bigger challenge coming — to defend our Mid Season Cup (MSC) title. We'll take a week off to rest and then all focus goes to Riyadh."

SRG.OG and Homebois will represent Malaysia at the Mid Season Cup x Esports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, next month.
