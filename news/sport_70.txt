Karim returns as MA president as Shahidan withdraws

KUALA LUMPUR: Datuk Karim Ibrahim is back as the president of Malaysia Athletics (MA).

Karim defeated Datuk Mark Ling 25-14 in what became a straight fight for the top post following the withdrawal of incumbent president Datuk Seri Shahidan Kassim and Datuk Wan Hisham Wan Salleh.

Shahidan and Wan Hisham, who had also been nominated, announced their withdrawal at the start of the annual general meeting, which was held at Wisma OCM today (June 15).

Wan Hisham, however, contested the deputy president's post instead and won with 22 votes, beating Sallehuddin Satar (5) and Mohamat Hassan (9).

atuk R. Annamali (24), Padmanathan Nagappan (22) and Prof Dr Mohamed Rusli Abdullah (29) took the three vice president slots, beating Ismail Mohd Ibrahim (12), Iyaru Muthusamy (5), David William (15) and John Ayavu (10).

Karim, who had previously helmed MA between 2014-2019, hopes all parties involved in Malaysian athletics can move forward together.

"I hope all the negative words spoken during the campaign (period) can be put aside and be forgotten. We must now focus on rebuilding confidence in the sport," said Karim.

"We have to work together as a team to face the upcoming Thailand Sea Games.

"As I have said before, the grassroots is also very important and remains a priority for me."

Karim also expressed his appreciation to Shahidan who helmed MA in two stints from 2006-2012 and 2022-2025.
