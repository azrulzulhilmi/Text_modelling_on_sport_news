Shahidan withdraws from MA elections, backs Karim instead

KUALA LUMPUR: Datuk Seri Shahidan Kassim has withdrawn from Malaysia Athletics' (MA) elections and will not be defending the president's post.

Shahidan dropped the bombshell during the MA annual general meeting today (June 15) at Wisma OCM.

Datuk Wan Hisham Wan Salleh, who had also been nominated for president, also withdrew. It is now a straight fight for the president's post between Datuk Mark Ling and Datuk Karim Ibrahim.

Shahidan, who had helmed the national body since 2022, said he decided to make way for Karim and focus on other matters.

"Although I had a chance of winning, I have decided to withdraw and make way for my friend Datuk Karim who has also offered himself for the position," said Shahidan.

"Personally, I feel that I need to focus on one sports association for the time being. I would like to give others the opportunity to bring change in the sport (athletics).

"What is important now is that Malaysian athletics continues to move forward.

"We have set a high target for the upcoming Thailand Sea Games and I am confident we can achieve it, especially with support from the National Sports Council."

Shahidan had previously held the MA president's position between 2006-2012. He is also the current president of Malaysia Aquatics.
