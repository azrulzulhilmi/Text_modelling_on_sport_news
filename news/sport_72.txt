Gillian leads charge, Li Jane stays alive at US Open

KUALA LUMPUR: National bowler Gillian Lim produced her strongest performance yet on the PWBA Tour by finishing second overall after 24 games of qualifying at the US Women's Open in Lincoln, Nebraska on Saturday.

Making her debut in the season's most demanding major, the 25-year-old impressed with a 4,944 pinfall total, trailing only American veteran Missy Parkin (5,003) heading into Sunday's final block at Sun Valley Lanes.

Gillian's form marks a clear statement of intent, continuing a strong run that includes back-to-back top 10 finishes at the PWBA Rock n' Roll Open and Bowlers Journal Waterloo Open.

"Yes, definitely. It feels really encouraging to see the progress, especially after a tough start earlier in the season," said Gillian.

"I've been focusing a lot on my timing and spare shooting, just trying to stay consistent each day. The lanes have been challenging, but I think my preparation and mental game helped a lot in the first few days."

Gillian is among four Malaysians who made the top 36 cut from the 108-woman field — joined by Natasha Roslan (12th, 4,827), Sin Li Jane (26th, 4,694) and Nora Lyana Nastasia Norkamal (30th, 4,682).

While Gillian sets the pace, the spotlight also remains on Li Jane, the reigning PWBA Tour Player of the Year, who is bidding to defend the title she won last year.

"It's the US Open. Anything is possible," said the 32-year-old, who must deliver a strong showing in the next eight games to break into the top 24 for the match-play phase.

The scores will be carried forward into match play, with only the top five advancing to Tuesday's stepladder finals — making Sunday's block a crucial one, particularly for Li Jane and Nora.

Compatriots Alisha Iman Cheong (45th, 4,202), Siti Safiyah Amirah Abdul Rahman (47th, 4,593) and Esther Cheah (81st, 4,374) missed the cut.
