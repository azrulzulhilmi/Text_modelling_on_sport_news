Aliff aims to become Malaysia's first Muay Thai world champion

KUALA LUMPUR: Muay Thai star Ahmad Nor Iman Aliff Rakib has no regrets leaving school at the age of 14 to pursue the Art of Eight Limbs as a career.

The son of Malaysian boxing legend Rakib Ahmad, Aliff was drawn to Muay Thai after accompanying his brother to a fight when he was seven.

Captivated by what he saw, Aliff expressed his interest in having a go at it, and was thrown into a bout that same day. It ended in a draw.

From there, Aliff began training under his father before asking to be sent to Thailand at the age of 14 to further his development.

However, adapting to life in Thailand proved challenging for Aliff, who wasn't used to the language and unfamiliar surroundings.

"I struggled in school and was only interested in Muay Thai training," said the 21-year-old when met at his newly opened gym in Setapak recently.

"So I asked my dad to send me to train in Thailand. At that time, Muay Thai wasn't very big in Malaysia, and it was hard to get quality coaching and sparring partners here.

"But when I arrived in Thailand, I struggled to communicate and adapt as I didn't speak their language.

"It was difficult making friends — the Thai boys didn't like having a foreigner training with them. They would steal my blanket and my fan. Once, I came home to visit my family and told my dad I didn't want to return to Thailand.

"He said 'If you don't go back to Thailand, what do you want to do with your life?' That struck me as I had already quit school, and Muay Thai was all I had.

"So I toughened up and trained even harder because I didn't have any other options. I have to make it in Muay Thai.

"I have no regrets leaving school, as fighting has given me everything I have today."

"My parents had to pay for my stay and training in Thailand, and we weren't well-off either. So they have sacrificed a lot for me," added the Kelantan-born fighter.

"But now, after earning a living through Muay Thai, I can repay them. I have also managed to purchase a plot of land in my hometown and open this gym.

"My dream is to open more gyms across the country so that more Muay Thai fighters can train and have a career in the sport."

Aliff has quickly built an impressive record of 53 wins and seven defeats, catching the attention of ONE Championship scouts.

He was given the opportunity to compete in ONE's Friday Fight Night series, where he secured four consecutive victories, three by knockout, earning US$10,000 (RM42,385) for each KO.

That remarkable run earned him a contract worth US$100,000 (RM423,850) with Asia's premier fighting promotion in 2023.

After two losses, Aliff has since strung together four straight wins, including a KO of Morocco's Zakaria El Jamari, which earned him a US$50,000 (RM211,925) bonus.

His most recent triumph was a unanimous decision over Zakaria's younger brother, Elmehdi, on June 7, positioning him as the next challenger for Prajanchai P.K. Saenchai's ONE strawweight world title.

"I want to be the first Muay Thai world champion from Malaysia. I believe I will fight Prajanchai next for the world title," he said.

"I want to prove that a Malaysian can challenge the world's best and succeed. I believe I have the tools to win."

Beyond becoming a world champion, Aliff harbours another dream — to win an Olympic gold medal.

Although Muay Thai is not on the programme for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, it was showcased as an exhibition sport at Paris 2024, hinting at potential future inclusion.

"Malaysia has struggled to win an Olympic gold medal, and I want to be the first person to achieve it," he said.

"I'm confident that Muay Thai will be included in the Olympic Games in the future, as it has already been contested in other multi-sport events."

For young athletes aspiring to follow in his footsteps, Aliff has a simple advice: "You need hard work, passion and a tough heart. If you can't endure hardship, this sport isn't for you."

From the boy who once struggled in a foreign land to the fighter now standing on the brink of greatness, Aliff's journey proves that sometimes, taking the unconventional path leads to extraordinary places.
