Homebois earn World Cup spot after edging DX Soul

KUALA LUMPUR: Homebois have booked their ticket to next month's Mid Season Cup x Esports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia after advancing to the Grand Finals of the Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB) Professional League Malaysia (MPL MY).

They secured their spot after a hard-fought 3-2 win over newly promoted DX Soul in the lower bracket final at Juara Stadium today. Earlier, DX had edged Aero Esports 3-2 in the lower bracket decider.

The win set up a showdown between Homebois and MPL MY champions Selangor Red Giants (SRG.OG) tomorrow for the Season 15 crown.

In a fiercely contested lower bracket final, both teams battled to 2-2, forcing a fifth and deciding game.

In the 15th minute, DX launched an assault on Homebois' base with the Lord's assistance, but the Owls mounted a resolute defence, aided by a double kill from midlaner Irwandy "Izanami" Lim.

Homebois then hunted down DX's final player, Dale Rolan "Stowm" Vidor, before marching into DX's base to seal victory.

Last season, Homebois — the Season 12 champions — failed to qualify for the playoffs. However, they have surprised many this year, finishing second in the regular season standings.

"As everyone knows, Homebois' journey has been a roller coaster — we were up, then down. I believe our strong form this year is also part of God's plan," said Homebois' owner Nureddy "Daddyhood" Nursal.

"I was confident my boys could beat DX. They are a realistic and optimistic bunch. Even in the games they lost, they stayed calm and reset quickly.

"Playing five games shows the competitiveness of both teams and the league, especially since DX were just promoted from the MLBB Academy League. I think the fans got their money's worth today."

SRG.OG defeated Homebois 3-2 in the upper bracket final two weeks ago, booking their place in Riyadh and a chance to become the first team in MPL MY history to win three consecutive titles.
