Martyn, Esther claim Sea Triathlon titles, eye Sea Games next

KUALA LUMPUR: National triathletes Martyn Lim and Esther Joy rose to the occasion with commanding victories in the elite Sprint races at the Southeast Asia (Sea) Triathlon Federation Championships, held as part of the Perak Multisport Festival in Lumut on Saturday.

Martyn, who finished fifth overall and was the fastest Malaysian last year, went one better this

time by clocking 1:03:57s to clinch the men's title, which featured a 750m swim, 20km bike, and 5km run.

He held off compatriot and former Sea Games silver medallist Rikigoro Shinozuka (1:05:25), with Singapore's Rusell Lee (1:06:10) completing the podium.

"I didn't come in with big expectations — just focused on going hard in the swim and seeing who came up with me on the bike," said Martyn.

"I think I had a pretty good swim by managing to latch onto some feet, which made it quite comfortable. The bike felt really good — the speed was there — and on the run I was out there alone but able to hold a strong pace and finish well."

Martyn credited his familiarity with the course as an advantage, having raced here in the past few editions.

"That definitely gave me an edge. I knew when to attack, when to hold back, and when to start pushing for the finish," he added.

With the championships serving as the final selection race for the Sea Games, Martyn is hopeful his performance sealed the deal.

In the women's race, Esther crossed the line in 1:10:25 to finish well ahead of Singaporeans Lim Wan Ting (1:12:48) and Regine Goh (1:15:07), marking a step up from her runner-up finish last year.

"This was a good win — not necessarily for how fast I went, but for how I executed it," said

Esther.

"I really challenged myself, especially in the swim and bike. It wasn't about outright speed today — it was about racing smart, and I'm quite proud of that."

Fresh off her win at the national championships in Putrajaya, Esther is also vying for a Sea

Games return.

"I'm not too sure what the coaches will decide, but based on the results, I hope I get in."

Esther, who made her debut at the 2021 Sea Games in Hanoi just six months into competitive triathlon, brings an unlikely background to the sport.

"I actually come from wushu," she revealed.

"I was in the national team for Nanquan discipline for a half years before COVID-19 struck. I was losing interest after a while as we could not train and there wasn't any competition.

"I eventually picked up triathlon. Interestingly, I never cycled before triathlon, but the leg strength from wushu helped a lot, especially on the bike.

"Power wasn't the issue — it was just learning the skills."
