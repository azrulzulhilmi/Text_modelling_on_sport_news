Shahmalarani eyes first gold at Sea Championships

KUALA LUMPUR: National karate exponent C. Shahmalarani is eyeing her first gold medal at the Southeast Asian Championships in Brunei from June 17-19.

The 26-year-old Selangor-born fighter came close in past editions, bagging silver and bronze in the women's kumite under-50kg at the 2023 Manila and 2024 Bangkok events respectively.

Fresh from winning silver at the Asian Championships in Uzbekistan last month, Shahmalarani sees Brunei as both a title opportunity and a dress rehearsal for the Thailand Sea Games in December.

"It's a crucial tournament, especially with the Sea Games coming up," said the 2021 (Hanoi) and 2023 (Phnom Penh) Sea Games champion.

"This event allows us to gauge our opponents' strengths. Some countries will send their newbies, others will send seasoned athletes. It's vital for us to gather experience and tactical info."

Despite already having Sea Games golds under her belt, Shahmalarani admits she's still hungry for that elusive Sea Championships crown.

"Winning gold here is something I've yet to do, and I want to add it to my list," she said.

Her recent success in Uzbekistan has made her a marked athlete in Brunei, and she knows it.

"I understand everyone will be gunning for me and that's normal in sport. I just need to give it my all.

"There's a bit of pressure, but that comes with the territory, especially in karate."
