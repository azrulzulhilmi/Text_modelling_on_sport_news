Aaron calls for VAR technology to reduce controversies

KUALA LUMPUR: Aaron Chia has urged the Badminton World Federation (BWF) to implement Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology to reduce controversial decisions by match officials.

The shuttler felt that several national players — himself included — have fallen victim to questionable calls, particularly on service faults.

Last month, during the second round of the Malaysia Masters, Kang Khai Xing-Aaron Tai were at the centre of a contentious umpiring decision during their match against Denmark's Rasmus Kjaer-Frederik Sogaard.

While the Malaysian duo were leading 14-12 in the rubber, Kjaer's smash appeared to have gone wide. However, Swiss umpire Peter Meszaros ruled that the shuttle had brushed Aaron Tai's head instead, and awarded the point to the Danes. Had a video referral been in place, it would have shown that the shuttle did not touch Aaron Tai.

Aaron Chia said that service judges are prone to misjudgment due to their lower vantage point compared to players on the court.

"I think BWF should introduce a VAR system, similar to what football has. For service faults, especially, something needs to be done as the angle from which service judges view can differ," said Aaron Chia today.

"Even though the service measuring device is fixed at 1.15 metres, the varying heights of the judges affect how they see the serve."

Aaron Chia was also left disheartened at the Singapore Open earlier this month when a critical service was faulted during the final against South Korea's Kim Won Ho-Seo Seung Jae, halting his momentum with partner Soh Wooi Yik.

He also called on the BWF to be more considerate when dealing with players requesting medical attention mid-match, noting that not all such requests are made in bad faith.

"Some players might use medical timeouts to gain an advantage, but not all. There are genuinely injured players who need treatment, and I hope the BWF takes this into account," he added.
