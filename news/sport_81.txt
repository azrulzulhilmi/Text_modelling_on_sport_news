Pearly says the ball is in BAM's court

PETALING JAYA: Shuttlers Pearly Tan-M. Thinaah are waiting patiently as they say the ball is now in the Badminton Association of Malaysia's (BAM) court regarding their contracts.

The national No. 1 women's doubles pair are still yet to renew their contracts in BAM which expired last December but Pearly said all the discussions had been completed and they are waiting for BAM to make an announcement. 
 
A press conference is expected to take place soon.
 
"It's not that I'm purposely delaying things. I'm also waiting for an answer. There will be a press conference but I don't know when," said Pearly when approached by the media at the Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM) in Bukit Kiara on Friday (June 20).
 
BAM officials were initially supposed to meet Pearly-Thinaah after the Thailand Open last month for final talks on their future in the national body.
 
The meeting though was postponed due to the duo's hectic tournament schedule.
 
Pearly-Thinaah, who went on to win the Thailand tourney, have a break from competitions now before they are due to play next in the back-to-back Japan Open from July 15-20 and China Open from July 22-27.
