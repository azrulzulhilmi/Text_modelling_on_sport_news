Top seed Rachel vows to stay sharp against Aifa in semis 

PETALING JAYA: National squash player Rachel Arnold is inching closer to capturing the Asian Championships title, but now a familiar face stands in her way en route to the final in Sarawak.

Top seed Rachel has been flawless in the tournament so far, winning all her matches in straight sets, including her quarter-final match against Hong Kong’s Tong Tsz Wing. She won 11-8, 11-8, 11-8 at the Sarawak Squash Centre in Kuching yesterday.

It was sweet revenge for Rachel, who came close to becoming Asian champion in 2021 but was denied by Tsz Wing in the final in Pakistan.

But Rachel now has to make it past compatriot Aifa Azman in the semi-finals today, after the fifth seed delivered an upset over Hong Kong’s joint third-fourth seed Lee Ka Yi, winning 11-5, 11-7, 11-4 in the quarter-finals.

Aifa has been on a superb run as well, not dropping a set on her way to the semi-finals, and that’s why Rachel is staying cautious as she intends to get her revenge for missing out on the title four years ago.

“I’m feeling confident, but I still have to stay sharp in order to win the championship. I got close to winning in 2021, so I’m really hoping to redeem it this time,” she said.

Meanwhile, sixth seed Yee Xin Ying also handed an upset to Aira Azman as she defeated her second seed countrywoman 11-6, 12-10, 9-11, 11-8 in the last eight.

It could have been another all-Malaysian semi-finals, but Xin Ying will be meeting Hong Kong’s Ho Tze Lok today instead of Noor Ainaa Amani Ampandi.

Tze Lok had sent Ainaa packing after a lengthy quarter-final clash, coming from behind to win 11-4, 9-11, 7-11, 11-7, 11-5.

However, Malaysia’s campaign in the men’s department came to an end yesterday after both Joachim Chuah and C. Ameeshenraj lost their quarter-final matches.

Fourth seed S. Velavan of India proved too much for Joachim, who fell 7-11, 6-11, 6-11, while Ameeshenraj lost to top seed Abdulla Al-Tamimi of Qatar 7-11, 9-11, 3-11.
