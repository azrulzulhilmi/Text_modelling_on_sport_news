Don't get comfortable, Rexy warns high-flying doubles pairs

KUALA LUMPUR: Coaching director Rexy Mainaky has warned the country's top doubles shuttlers not to rest on their laurels despite a string of promising results.

Rexy, a former Olympic champion, stressed that the road to the 2028 Los Angeles Games is still long and full of hurdles and urged his players to remain hungry, disciplined and focused.

"I'm pleased with their performances so far, but we cannot afford to get comfortable," said Rexy.

"There are still many tournaments ahead, and Olympic qualification is far from settled. If we allow ourselves to be easily content, that will be our downfall.

"But if we stay driven and work hard, I believe — with the right support — we truly have a shot at our first Olympic gold in 2028."

Malaysia currently boast four men's doubles pairs ranked inside the world's top 25, a healthy sign for their hopes of sending two pairs to LA28.

Under Badminton World Federation (BWF) rules, each nation may field a maximum of two pairs per doubles event at the Olympics, provided both are inside the top eight at the end of the qualification period.

At present, professional duo Goh Sze Fei-Nur Izzuddin Rumsani top the world rankings, followed by Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik at No. 2. Man Wei Chong-Tee Kai Wun sit seventh, while Yap Roy King-Wan Arif Wan Junaidi are 24th.

Rexy believes the depth in the men's doubles ranks bodes well for the national team's long-term Olympic ambitions.

"Right now, we have two pairs in the top two. Behind them, Wei Chong-Kai Wun and Roy King-Arif are closing in," he said.

"This is very encouraging. It boosts our players' confidence and adds pressure on our rivals.

"Our target is to have all four pairs inside the top four when the 2028 Games come around. That will create healthy internal competition for the two Olympic slots."

It's been a stellar season so far for the Malaysian men's doubles.

Sze Fei-Izzuddin clinched the India Open in January en route to becoming world No. 1.

Aaron-Wooi Yik, meanwhile, lifted three titles — the Badminton Asia Championships, Thailand Open and Singapore Open.

Wei Chong-Kai Wun have also impressed, picking up the Indonesia Masters and Malaysia Masters crowns, while Roy King-Arif continue to improve since forming their partnership last year.

Two pairs — Aaron-Wooi Yik and Wei Chong-Kai Wun — are currently part of the Road to Gold (RTG) programme, an elite initiative designed to help Malaysia finally capture its first Olympic gold in 2028.

Also in the RTG setup are women's world No. 3 Pearly Tan-M. Thinaah and mixed doubles world No. 4 Chen Tang Jie-Toh Ee Wei.

Professional pairs, Sze Fei-Izzuddin and Goh Soon Huat-Shevon Lai may also be included, subject to agreement on terms.

"The RTG began earlier than similar initiatives in other countries, so we've got a head start," added Rexy.

"But ultimately, it all comes down to the players' commitment. If they stay disciplined and don't get easily satisfied, I truly believe we can finally bring home that elusive gold."
