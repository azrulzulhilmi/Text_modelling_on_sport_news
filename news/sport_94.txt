Nafuzi adopts bold approach to evaluate players  ahead of AFF U-23 C’ship

PETALING JAYA: With time ticking ahead of the AFF Under-23 Championship in Jakarta, Malaysia coach Nafuzi Zain is taking a bold approach in evaluating players – he has rolled out a series of internal sparring matches called the Elite Games.

The initiative, which runs from June 22-25, aims to provide a testing ground for 26 of the nation’s most promising young footballers.

It’s a critical phase for Nafuzi, who has less than a month to shape a squad capable of navigating a tricky Group A that features the Philippines (July 15), Brunei (July 18), and hosts Indonesia (July 21) at the iconic Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta.

“We have a lot of youngsters who represent the future of Malaysian football,” said Nafuzi.

“This Elite Games phase allows us to monitor these players closely before our centralised camp starts on July 1.”

Nafuzi, known for his keen eye for youth development from his days with Terengganu and Kedah, is putting faith in locally based players, as the AFF U-23 Championship will feature a fully domestic squad.

“It’s a short window to evaluate and prepare, but this platform gives us clarity on the boys’ technical abilities, mental strength and how they respond in competitive situations,” he added.

Complementing the talent pool are players like centreback Ubaidullah Shamsul and striker Haqimi Azim Rosli, who have trained with the senior squad.

That stint, according to Nafuzi, offered invaluable exposure and a taste of the standards required at the highest level.

“We’re working closely with coach Peter (Cklamovski), and the playing style we’re adopting mirrors the national team’s. That’s essential for continuity and long-term development.”
