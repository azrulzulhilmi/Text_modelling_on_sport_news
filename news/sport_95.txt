First pickleball instructor course held in Sibu

Malaysia Pickleball Asso­ciation (MPA) conducted its first Central Zone Level 1 Cert­ified Instructor course in Sibu, marking a milestone in the development of the sport in Sarawak.

This initiative, hosted by Sibu Pickleball Association (SPA), drew 34 enthusiastic participants, including two delegates from Kuching and four from Sarikei.

Presiding over the course at SMK Sacred Heart was MPA president Farrell Choo, who led the training and assessments.

Choo said the programme not only served as a platform to enhance technical knowledge and coaching skills, but also as a strategic step towards building a stronger coaching community in Sabah and Sarawak.

Participants who complete the course will be officially recognised as Level 1 Certi­fied Instructors, enabling them to contribute to the sport’s growth at grassroots and school levels.

Expressing his gratitude, SPA president Joseph Chieng said, “We are thankful to MPA for its unwavering support.

“Hosting this course in Sibu empowers our local players and educators to take on leadership roles within the sport.”

Chieng said SPA aimed to continue collaborating with national and state-level bodies to organise further professional development programmes and tournaments, positioning Sibu as an emerging hub for pickleball activities in Sarawak.

Meanwhile, some 200 to 300 participants from across Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo are expected to take part in Borneo Pickleball Workshop and Forum on Aug 27 and 28 in Sibu.

The inaugural event will be organised by iPlay Swan Squad Pickleball Club (iPSS) with full backing from Business Events Sarawak, which aims to promote the development of pickleball in Borneo, especially in Sarawak.

iPSS president Dr Wong Chya Wei said the forum represented a vital step towards building a stronger and more structured pickleball community in the region.

“This is more than just a forum. It’s a movement to raise the profile of pickleball.

“We anticipate coaches, educators, club organisers and the public joining in,” he said at a press conference.

Dr Wong said one of the event highlights would be a dialogue session featuring representatives from Sarawak Sports Council, MPA and pickleball court operators.

Other activities on the agenda include specialist talks on flooring, seminars on sports injuries and rehabilitation, as well as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) workshops, which will be offered free to the public.

There will also be a referee workshop for those interested in becoming officials or line judges, besides an exhibition area focusing on pickleball gear, court construction solutions, booking systems, and sporting equipment.

“Junior players will showcase a match on a specially prepared court set up within a hotel ballroom – the first of its kind in Malaysia.

“We invite people from all back­grounds to join us, especially those with experience in racquet sports like tennis, badminton, table tennis and squash, as transitioning to pickleball is straightforward and enjoyable.

“As an extra incentive, the first 100 registrants will be treated to a complimentary sunset river cruise on Aug 27,” he added.
