Sizzling 65 puts Anson top of boys’ competition

PETALING JAYA: National golfer Anson Yeo (pic) has put himself in a strong position to claim his third title of the year after a commanding performance in the TSM Golf Challenge at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club yesterday.

The 19-year-old shot a sizzling six-under 65 to go on top of the leaderboard of the boy’s competition.

Anson was placed second after an opening round of two-under 69 but now has a comfortable four-stroke lead with his two day total of eight-under 134.

His teammate Hariz Hezri is his closest rival, positioned at second place after a four-under 67 for a total of four-under 138.

G. Nateeshvar lies in third place after a similar four-under 67 for a total of two-under 140.

P. Jonathan, the first day leader with his three-under 68, dropped seven rungs to place eighth after a four-over 75 yesterday.

The reigning Malaysia Games (Sukma) winner Anson from Sarawak was pleased with his fine run in the meet.

“I have played well on this course. I won a junior tournament here a few years back, so I am familiar with the layout and greens,” said Anson.

“I putted well and my ball striking was okay. I want to continue the same approach tomorrow and hopefully close well.”

Anson won the SGCC Championship earlier in the year and pulled off a stunning win in the PGM Tun Ahmad Sarji Trophy last month.

Defending girls’ champion Mirabel Ting made her move with a three-under 68 to top the field by six shots despite a double bogey in the 18th hole.

Nik Alicia Miriam Kamil Nik Fairuz Kamil was the closest finisher behind Mirabel after an even-par 72 for a total of 144.

Cambodia SEA Games bronze medallist Foong Zi Yu was three stroke behind at the third spot on 147 (71-76).
